## About the Project

This project introduces advanced usage of Python generators to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations. The tasks focus on leveraging Pythonâ€™s yield keyword to implement generators that provide iterative access to data, promoting optimal resource utilization, and improving performance in data-driven applications.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

Master Python Generators: Learn to create and utilize generators for iterative data processing, enabling memory-efficient operations.
Handle Large Datasets: Implement batch processing and lazy loading to work with extensive datasets without overloading memory.
Simulate Real-world Scenarios: Develop solutions to simulate live data updates and apply them to streaming contexts.
Optimize Performance: Use generators to calculate aggregate functions like averages on large datasets, minimizing memory consumption.
Apply SQL Knowledge: Use SQL queries to fetch data dynamically, integrating Python with databases for robust data management.
